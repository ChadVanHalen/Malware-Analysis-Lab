<h1>Malware Analysis Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of getting hands-on experience dealing with malware in a quarantined VM network and using tools like WireShark, ProcMon, and Cutter to perform both static and dynamic analysis<br/>
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>
 
- <b>PowerShell</b>
- <b>VirusTotal</b>
- <b>PEStudio</b>
- <b>PEStudio</b>
- <b>Floss</b>
- <b>Capa</b>
- <b>Cutter</b>
- <b>WireShark</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 - FlareVM</b>
- <b>Ubuntu Server 22.04.1 - REMnux</b>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Since this project has multiple, somewhat lengthy parts, I will be breaking them down into sections. This introductory section is just to set the foundation<br/>
Here I'm on my Windows 10 VM installing Falre VM, a set of pre-defined tools that can aid in the analysis of malware. I am also running an instance of REMnux, a Linux distro that also provides pre-defined tools, mostly for the use of malware analysis.<br/>
For this process, I'll need to make sure my Windows 10 is as unsecure as possible, turning off all Windows Defender safety features, which annoyingly seemed to turn themselves back on at multiple steps of this project.<br/>
For these early steps, REMnux will mostly be used with it INETSIM tool to act as a DNS for the Win10 VM once we cut it off from the network.<br/>
Once I can ping each from machine from the other machine, I'm able to move on:<br/>

Now with the environments set, I need to introduce the test subject. For this project I will be looking at the infamous Zeus Trojan<br/>
Once I have the ZIP file downloaded I'll triple check that both the VMs are set to "Host Only Adapter" networks, so they are cut off from the internet, and most importantly, my LAN:<b/>

<br />
<br />
Now that the computer is isolated, the malware can be fully introduced to the system. The malware is behind a password given by the GitHub source to prevent accidental download and detonation: <br/>

<br />
<br />
In the next sections I will perform both static and dyanmic analysis on the malware, utilizing multiple different tools. Each tool provides similar functionalities, but with slightly different spins on each tool.
